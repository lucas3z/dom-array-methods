Project built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and with the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me):

- Fetch data from the API and make random amount of money
- Double the money of each person using the map function
- Show only millionaires using the filter function
- Sort people by richest using the sort function
- Calculate the entire wealth using the reduce function
